### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free)

2. Push your website files to this repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Configure your custom domain in GitHub Pages settings

2. Drag and drop your website folder or connect to a Git repository
3. Configure your custom domain in Netlify settings

### Option 3: Vercel (Free tier available)
1. Create a Vercel account
2. Connect to a Git repository or deploy directly
3. Configure your custom domain in Vercel settings

### Option 4: Traditional hosting (Paid)

## 3. Connect Your Domain to Your Hosting

After setting up hosting, you'll need to connect your domain:

1. In your domain registrar, update the nameservers to point to your hosting provider
   OR
2. Add DNS records (typically an A record or CNAME) to point to your hosting

Your hosting provider will give you specific instructions for this step.

## 4. Upload Your Website Files

If using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, your files will be deployed automatically.

If using traditional hosting, you'll need to upload your files via FTP:
1. Get FTP credentials from your hosting provider
2. Use an FTP client (like FileZilla) to upload files to your server

## 5. SSL Certificate (HTTPS)

Most modern hosting providers offer free SSL certificates:
- GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel provide this automatically
- For traditional hosting, you may need to install a Let's Encrypt certificate
